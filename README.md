## Title LEXISNEXIS IS SELLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO ICE SO IT CAN TRY TO PREDICT CRIMES:

ICE uses LexisNexis to track people's cars, gather information on people, and make arrests for its deportation machine, according to a contract.

## Article 2 [ice](https://theintercept.com/2023/06/20/lexisnexis-ice-surveillance-license-plates/)

ICE agents have been using a database of nationwide license plate numbers supplied by local police departments to target unauthorized immigrants. The trade in bulk license plate data is generally unregulated, and information about scanned plates is indiscriminately aggregated, stored, shared, and eventually sold through companies like LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters. Many believe that the use of LPRs to track immigrants may lead to racial profiling and discrimination, as the technology is more likely to misidentify people of color. The ACLU has "grave concerns about the civil liberties risks of license plate readers take on greater urgency as this surveillance information fuels ICE’s deportation machine".

The article notes that the use of surveillance technology in immigration enforcement is not new, but the use of LPRs has raised new concerns about racial bias. The federal government released a report on bias issues in face recognition algorithms, finding that the systems generally work best on middle-aged white men’s faces, and not so well for people of color, women, children, or the elderly.
